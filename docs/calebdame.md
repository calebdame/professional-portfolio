### Life Goals

![Screenshot](/assets/me.jpg){align=right ; style="height:250px;width:250px"}

* I want to always be learning new things: software, languages, domain knowledge, ways of thinking, etc.
* I want build tools that make people smile and get them excited about things they never would have though about before.
* I want to use simple data to find value that goes unnoticed to push for new frontiers.

## My Story

I grew up in Petaluma, California which is about 45 minutes north of San Francisco.  I have a dad who works in animation, a mom who went back to school 15 years ago to be a nurse, an older brother doing a PhD in Planetary Science, three younger sisters, and an amazing wife. When I was 18, I left my home to serve a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Northern France.  I still take every opportunity to use my French, even if its listening to Harry Potter audiobook in French.

When I got back, I attended Brigham Young University in Utah, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, mostly because I was good at Math in high school, I did not quite know what I wanted to do, and applying Math sounded a lot more interesting than not applying it.  I graduated after 4 years, and while I was there I learned that programming was fun, I got married, and I taught French 101 for 2.5 years.

I now am the proud owner of an English Bulldog Puppy "Bear", and in my free time I work on the types of things you'll see on this sight: work at the intersection of Statistics, Economics, Machine Learning, Fun code, and creating random things on a computer.
