I want to use simple data to find value that goes unnoticed to push for new frontiers. My Story \u00b6 I grew up in Petaluma, California which is about 45 minutes north of San Francisco. I have a dad who works in animation, a mom who went back to school 15 years ago to be a nurse, an older brother doing a PhD in Planetary Science, three younger sisters, and an amazing wife. When I was 18, I left my home to serve a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Northern France. I still take every opportunity to use my French, even if its listening to Harry Potter audiobook in French. When I got back, I attended Brigham Young University in Utah, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, mostly because I was good at Math in high school, I did not quite know what I wanted to do, and applying Math sounded a lot more interesting than not applying it. I graduated after 4 years, and while I was there I learned that programming was fun, I got married, and I taught French 101 for 2.5 years. I now am the proud owner of an English Bulldog Puppy \"Bear\", and in my free time I work on the types of things you'll see on this sight: work at the intersection of Statistics, Economics, Machine Learning, Fun code, and creating random things on a computer.

To name just a few of the reasons ... Interpretability: The linear parametrization is so easy to understand that Financial Advisors know what's going on Closed-Form Solution: The formula is unique (if it exists!) and we can compute it in a resonable time --- O(n^3) O(n^3) , which is a lot, but still usually faster than many models that use any form of gradient descent or boosting. And, when it meets the Gauss-Markov Assumptions , each \\beta \\beta parameter will converge on a causal effect However , when the model's noise is distributed with infinite variance (or close enough that it may as well be infinite), OLS no longer converges via the Central Limit Theorem . This means that confidence intervals may no longer be used effectively.

A few variations of cost functionals are proposed in a paper of mine exploring this topic. Our Proposed Cost Functional Read in more depth or download it here Feature Selection for Causal Analysis in Stop and Frisk Dataset \u00b6 In the Stop, Question, and Frisk Dataset, collected by NYC Police to record all street police encounters, there are over 500 possible categories that can be filled out to describe an encounter. In order to get reliable and unbiased confidence intervals for estimates in statistical models, there can be too many features, and we can bias the model by including the wrong features. In order to algorithmically and consistently decide which features to include in a test for NYPD Racial Discrimination, I detail below in a paper how to use a Post-Double Selection LASSO model to choose parameters. After discarding all features obviously not relevant to the question of discrimination (meaning that we kept only information known by the officer before the stop), correctly using two different LASSO models can further weed out confounding erroneous factors that could deeply bias results. The final model finds the likelihood of firearms or drugs on the person stopped, and finds that being black decreases the likelihood of possession. This implies that Blacks were not only stopped in a higher proportion to their share of the population, but that the police were not completely justified for the stops since they were less successful by their stop-rates in finding contraband among Blacks than among any other racial subpopulation.

I this paper, we survey various time-series models such as the Auto-Regressive model, the Auto-Regressive Moving-Average model, Recurrent Neural Networks, and RNN-LSTMs An example Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) model We find that this age-old problem is complex and is still being researched to this day by thousands of Data Scientists.

In a research paper, we test the feasibility for AI to learn to recognise emotion, learn how generalizable emotion detection can be, and what problems or ethical concerns may stand in the way. Gradient-Boosted Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regressions are used to specify an accurate model that can detect any of 7 emotions: Surprise, Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Disgust, Fear, and Neutral (the absence of emotion).

In 2003, Colorado voters decided to remove the No-Fault mandate from the books. Using a statistical method of creating a couterfactual called Synthetic Control, after some assumptions we can estimate a Synthetic Colorado, where No-Fault was never voted away. Using this method, and checking various statistical tests, we see that it is quite possile that the pivot away from No-Fault lowered liability and collision premiums while also increasing the number of insured vehicles on the road: lowering costs, and enfranchising new drivers.
